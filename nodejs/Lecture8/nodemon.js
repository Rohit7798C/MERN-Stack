// 1) Everytime we make changes to the file, we have to save and run the file from the terminal
// 2) for that we install Nodemon that helps in refreshing the changes to the file without running the file again & again. 

// 3) nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.
// 4) Nodemon Installation : npm install -g nodemon
// 5) -g indicates that the package we are installing is accessible throughout the file

// 6) For using the nodemon we use command nodemon http_module.js
// 7) But in my case it is not working , so I have used npx nodemon http_module.js (And it worked!).
